# Tutorial Report - PostgreSQL Python: Inserting Data Into a Table
This tutorial report aims to create a table and insert data in PostgreSQL using Python.

## Installing PostgreSQL
Download PostgreSQL in your respective OS using [this link](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads) and follow the installation wizard.
Note: we do not need to install Stack Builder. Ensure that you remember your password, use port 5432, and use the default locale. 
Next, verify the installation by launching SQL Shell (psql). Enter the necessary information (accept the default by pressing enter), and provide the password you entered during installation.
Type in: 
```SELECT version();```
and you should see a line containing information with your version number.
